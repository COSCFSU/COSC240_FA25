# Set up some variables
x = input("Please enter a number>") # Prompts the user
y = input("Please enter another >")
x = float(x) # Converts it to the right type
y = float(y)
z = x + y

# Now print those out in cool ways
#print("hello world")
#print("hello","world")
print("hello" + "world")
print(x,"+",y,"=",z) # Prints out everything
